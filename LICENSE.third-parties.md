This module is based heavily on some of honeybadger's (Matthew Haentschke's) work, such as in https://github.com/trioderegion/fvtt-macros/tree/master/honeybadger-macros (which uses the MIT license).
Primarily the convert-to-loot macro found in [ConvertToLootSheet.js](https://github.com/trioderegion/fvtt-macros/blob/master/honeybadger-macros/actors/dnd5e/ConvertToLootSheet.js)
Which, in turn, was originally (long ago) based on my (Chris Barrett's/ygg#0922/tas) own work.
Thanks for helping _so many_ in the Foundry VTT community, including me!  <3

This module may also reference parts of [fvtt-loot-sheet-npc-5e](https://github.com/jopeek/fvtt-loot-sheet-npc-5e) (which uses the MIT license).
Since this is meant to be a simpler take on that module.
We'll see how that goes...
